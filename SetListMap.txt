List vs Set vs Map

Three interface

List:orderd, duplicate is ok,>1 null,
Set:no order, no duplicate, only one null,
Map:based on key-value, key always unique, may be duplicate value; one null key, >1 null value

when(need collection){
Case 1: you frequently access element with index, choose the implementation of List like ArrayList, LinkedList;
Case 2: element is unique, no order is required, then choose the implementation of Set like HashSet, TreeSet;
Case 3: need collection with mapping between key and value, then choose the implementation of Map like HashMap, Hashtable;

Note:
Hashtable: no null key neither null value
HashMap: one null key, more than one null value is possible,not synchronised
